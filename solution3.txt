Problem Statement 3: Explain the code snippet

Explain what the following code is attempting to do? You can explain by:
Explaining how the highlighted constructs work?
Giving use-cases of what these constructs could be used for.
What is the significance of the for loop with 4 iterations?
What is the significance of make(chan func(), 10)?
Why is “HERE1” not getting printed?

package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    cnp := make(chan func(), 10)
    for i := 0; i < 4; i++ {
        go func() {
            for f := range cnp {
                f()
            }
        }()
    }
    cnp <- func() {
        fmt.Println("HERE1")
    }
    fmt.Println("Hello")
}



Answer :- 

Constructs:
- make(chan func(), 10): Creates a buffered channel that can hold up to 10 functions.
- Goroutines with for loop: Starts 4 goroutines that continuously run functions received from the channel.

Use-Cases:
- Buffered channels: Useful for queuing tasks without blocking.
- Goroutines: Good for parallel processing, like handling multiple web requests at the same time.

Significance:
- For loop with 4 iterations: Launches 4 workers to handle tasks concurrently.
- Buffered channel: Allows sending tasks (functions) to the channel without waiting for an immediate receiver.

Why "HERE1" isn’t printed:
- The program exits before the goroutines get a chance to run the function that prints "HERE1". The "Hello" message is printed because it runs immediately.
